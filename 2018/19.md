# 2018 - 19

I've applied last minute to participate in the Torino Mini Maker Faire. I've proposed the usual Coding for everyone format, plus I'll show up at a booth, and I'll try to come up with something interesting for that.

I've finally had time to catch up on the diary for the bootcamp weeks. I still need to gather some material for the last few weeks. But it's progressing.

Coding for everyone was nice and busy with many new faces, I'm very happy about that :)

Lino Nocciole is finally coming together. We've updated all the existing plugins so that we can also translate everything in English and Italian. We still need to solve a minor issue with the cart icon and then write instructions.

We have started the Stripe integration on Efficacemente. Interesting to mix together React, Material UI, Stripe elements and soon AWS Lambda. It's becoming a really interesting project, hopefully it's going to be useful too!
