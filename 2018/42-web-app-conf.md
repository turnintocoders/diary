# WebApp Conf

A special entry on the [WebApp conf (recap with slides)](https://2018.webappconf.it/recap.html) that I've attended this week.

Quick notes of what I found interesting during the talks.

Intersting talk on styleguides.

## Form in Angular
Apparently it's all together, a bit messy, I don't like it :)


## Break
[Indian police movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_J7bVS1dnA) and [mad heidi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eWiB6X-Fho). We've skipped Korean and Japanese pop music. It's going to be for the next conference. Thanks Matteo :*


## MultimodalitÃ  nelle web app
Interesting concept in mixing MQTT as a tool to interact with web applications.
In particular the presentation showed an Alexa-enabled Vue app that was reacting to MQTT messages to filter a complex dashboard, without messing up the UI.

Interesting concept, maybe not the best example in my opinion.

## Performance and PWA
There's lots of hype around PWA and service worker. Would be good to have a side project in which experiment them.

What about isomorphic? Is it out of fashion? Maybe not, check [nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) out.


## CSS come se non ci fosse un domani
Loads of tricks to keep things simple, here's a [link to the slides](https://2018.webappconf.it/assets/images/slide/05-davide-di-pumpo.pdf)


## Lunch


## Framework agnostic state management
An in depth look of how all the flux-related state management tools work. Deep and interesting.


## Create React app from zero
A nice panorama on what is inside create-react-app. Why and what you should chose, why you need or not a boilerplate.

__Presentation__  
Am I able to create a boilerplate from scratch?
What about a super minimal app -> is it going to be our cinism-app?

__State management__  
Redux  
MobX

__Tooling__  
how to put everything together  
babel, webpack, folder organisation, etc

__Testing__  
which test runner, which react tester

Maybe a little too much for just one talk. And inspires to me loads of JS fatigue, unfortunately.


## Responsive without media queries
Very interesting approach, that I haven't thought much about, [here the slides](https://webappconf2018.slides.giko.it/#/9)
