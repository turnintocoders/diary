I'm on holiday, and luckily I have some time to read and think :)

So I've written this small newsletter article:

```
__Why you should learn to code__


Hello!

I hope you had a great summer :)

I've just read a very interesting article from The Guardian that I would like to recommend: Franken-algorithms: the deadly consequences of unpredictable code (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/29/coding-algorithms-frankenalgos-program-danger)

It's an exploration of what artificial intelligence and machine learning means, in plain english. It gives a few examples with self driving cars and high frequency trading in stock markets, while posing some important ethical questions.

When I read this quote I immediately thought of you:

    “And we will eventually give up writing algorithms altogether,” Walsh continues, “because the machines will be able to do it far better than we ever could. Software engineering is in that sense perhaps a dying profession. It’s going to be taken over by machines that will be far better at doing it than we are.”

    Walsh believes this makes it more, not less, important that the public learn about programming, because the more alienated we become from it, the more it seems like magic beyond our ability to affect.


I cannot agree more with this. And if you read through the entire article you'll see why the ethical implications of coding are so important and pervasive.

I think having people with diverse backgrounds and histories learn programming is one way to mitigate the risks highlighted in the article. Clearly the current programmers' monoculture is not working out.

Anyway, I highly suggest you reading the entire article, and maybe join us on Monday at our usual Coding for everyone (https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/events/fxjxspyxmbfb/) event, to learn more about programming. Especially if you don't have any prior experience in coding ;)

Happy coding!
