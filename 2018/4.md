# 2018 - 4

We went live with a first version of the [Freelance Day](http://www.freelanceday.it/) website. I've been fiddling around with [Evently](http://evently.mikado-themes.com/) and sorting out server configuration to keep alive the websites for the old events. Evently is very powerful, unfortunately it's a bit difficult to add code on top, but I'm getting away with it.

I've finalised the [Prebootcamp material](https://github.com/turnintocoders/bootcamp/tree/master/prebootcamp) that I've shared with the bootcampers. We need to test it together next week still.
