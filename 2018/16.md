# 2018 - 16

Good week with both our proposals being accepted.
We've started working on Efficacemente for whom we'll build a single page checkout with a React frontend and a serverless backend. Interesting!

We've also been given green light on a small ecommerce work, adding Snipcart to an existing WordPress installation. Which will be interesting for using what I've recently learnt with VVV and also to use Wordmove to deploy and have a repeatable setup.

With these two new projects coming in, I need to focus on Open House Torino to get that sorted before starting too many things at once. Luckily this week was good and I should be ready to go live next one with the latest changes.

Best part of the week was attending Droidcon! I met with lots of people, drunk too many coffees and experienced a couple of good talks in an outstanding venue. Good stuff.

We've also received very positive feedback to our newsletter, especially on the next bootcamp idea. I've received already some inquiry. Very positive compared to the first round, for which was very difficult to get feedback. Let's see when we start promoting for real.
