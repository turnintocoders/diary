# 2018 - 45

Wrote a newsletter for the upcoming workshop of next week: https://tinyletter.com/turnintocoders/letters/time-to-get-your-html-pages-online-then-join-the-next-free-workshop

The Meetup page is ready: https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/events/fxjxspyxpbqb/ and I've also prepared a workflow to show.

The week was quite short actually as I was alone with the kids for two days, making my work time much more limited than usual :)

I hope to make good progress on the bootcamp and Torino Wireless next week. Catch up soon!
