# 2018 - 18

Short week again because of the 1st of May public holiday. This time we also passed on Coding for everyone. Was a long while that we didn't have a break, sorry everyone, but we needed one!

Taking the chance of the time off I've almost finished the Open House website. It's not 100% done as I still need to implement some design input, but it's in a good shape to go live. I'll wait more content input before going ahead. It's much better than last year, let's hope it's going to be more useful.

I've been invited by [Hangar](http://www.hangarpiemonte.it/) to prepare a series of talks about coding as a creative profession. They are going to be held in libraries in order to promote creative culture and encourage people to try new career options. Very interesting and inline with the bootcamp spirit. I'm going to work for a proposal soon.

Coding-wise, we've stabilised Efficacemente on Material-UI v1. It was a bit of a rewrite, but the new version is much more complete. I'm pleased with the result. We've also figured out a couple of issues that we've had on theme customisation. We are now ready to finish the frontend and then work on the backend side of it.

Maison della Nocciola is almost ready. We need to finalise the cart behaviour and then we'll be ready for the boring data-entry.
