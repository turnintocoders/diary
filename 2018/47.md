# 2018 - 47

I've been spending most of my time dedicated to the bootcamp in contacting directly every person that applied to previous versions of the bootcamp but then didn't move forward.

A newsletter left my account too: [Last workshop of 2019: add some JavaScript to our landing pages](https://tinyletter.com/turnintocoders/letters/last-workshop-of-2019-add-some-javascript-to-our-landing-pages) about the upcoming workshop :)

Busy week for my mailing as I kept writing personally to potential candidates and people that showed interest in the project recently.
