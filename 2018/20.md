# 2018 - 20

The week started with a particular Coding for everyone, one of our participants brought pizza and beverages for everyone! That was an incredible surprise. I'm very thankful and happy for the participation that I'm seeing lately.

We've been asked to quote a project for a landing page that should be implemented straight away. We proposed again DatoCMS + Gatsby/another static site generator. Unfortunately the project was so time bound that we sent the quote too late (by a few hours...) and it was already too late. Too bad, but maybe it was too time constrained for us.

On Efficacemente we completed the Stripe integration with proper validation and error display. It's time to work on the server side with AWS Lamda and Zapier!
