# 2018 - 12 - TiC 1 - Week 7

Materials for week 7 are [here](https://github.com/turnintocoders/bootcamp/blob/master/week-7/README.md).

Introduing Vue.js and handlebars, we've created our [cryptoconverter](https://github.com/TiC-1/Week7_cryptoconverter).

## External speakers

Edoardo Tenani, from [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) has come to visit us this week. Edoardo is a good friend of mine and a very enthusiastic developer. He's given interesting perspective and ideas for our projects.

## Retrospective

Existing libraries has shown their power and there has been a generic enthusiasm. Good feedback on Handlebars, Express and Vue.JS.

The project went very very well.

We are still discussing on how to improve team organisation and code infrastructure, with linters and automatic code coverage.

There's been again interest in diving more into async and promises.
