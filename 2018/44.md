# 2018 - 44

On Monday we had a special workshop instead of our usual Coding for everyone. We've seen how to build an [HTML+CSS landing page](https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/events/fxjxspyxnbmc/).

There was a good attendance and I'm happy to see some more people getting interested in the bootcamp.

Apart from that not much to report as the week was short due to a public holiday.
