# 2018 - 13 - TiC 1 - Week 8

Materials for week 8 are [here](https://github.com/turnintocoders/bootcamp/blob/master/week-8/README.md).

We've started a project to map the skills that you can learn before, during and after the bootcamp, in an interactive D3.js application. Our [skills graph](https://github.com/TiC-1/Week8_Skills).

## External speakers

Lots of speakers this week!

We've had a full lecture on UX by Sharon & Thomas, a couple of friends met at the Coding for everyone events. Here are [the slides](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/1r26D9ORkxWSIs).

We met also Alessandro and Giulietta from [Byters](http://www.byters.it/) presenting their data analysis platform and gamification engine.
Stefano Verna from [Cantiere Creativo](https://www.cantierecreativo.net/) presented his project, a very promising headless CMS: [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/).
And we had another visit from the [MaieuticalLabs](https://maieuticallabs.it/) team to check the progress of the cohort.

## Retrospective

In retrospective the project that we decided to tackle was too difficult. D3 is too much as a final project, especially with some interactivity and going out of the known path. I would recommend something simpler.

The most cited GO was to go on holiday! The bootcamp has been exciting but also exhausting. We need a break!

There's a general need for revising the materials of the bootcamp.

Also a generalised desire to keep learning new things and carry on what has been done until now.

The UX workshop has been greatly appreciated and would be nice to have more of them, of course!

Think about a welcome pack. A kit of swag for newcomers :)

In retrospective was impressive the amount of stuff that people have learnt. Very good!
