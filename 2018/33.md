# 2018 - 33 - Hiatus

There has been a long hiatus in the diary.

I've been busy with finishing projects, promoting a new edition of the bootcamp but mostly with family life, that during the summer becomes quite important :)

I'll be back in September with more time to spend on Turn into Coders, trying to push for making the bootcamp happen again.
