# 2018 - 37

Not much to report, I'll still be juggling between family and projects for a while as the kids are home until October. Plus some weeks of adjustments.

The Drupal project is picking up, especially on the domain and mail migration, which is proving itself quite time consuming as the previous team is a bit difficul to manage.

On the Coding for everyone side I'm really happy as all the events are quite busy while I'm doing very little promotion for them. Great!
