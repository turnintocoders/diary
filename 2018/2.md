# 2018 - 2

Back from holidays with a very intense week.

[Edoardo](https://twitter.com/edoardotenani) moved on in your career ending our last year and a half of collaboration for Vitsoe. Has been a great pleasure and fun to work together! I'm sure we'll do something again at some point.

On the bootcamp side we had a very nice Coding for everyone with lots of new faces. I've prepared people to [next week's event](https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/events/bdgbfpyxcbtb/), which we'll do together with [Melacavo](http://melacavo.io), about console usage. We have many Windows users, we need to make sense also for them... Challenge accepted!

This week has been busy with accounting about the company, the office and the financing for the bootcamp. Job done though!

Thursday I've spoken to the [WordPress Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Meetup-Torino/events/246334593/) presenting my experience with building [Open House Torino](http://openhousetorino.it/). I've prepared a simple [deck of slides](https://turnintocoders.github.io/wp-fast-cheap-presentation/) for the event. I've been very happy of the feedback and the participation during the presentatin. Really great!

We are about to close the bootcamp's applications. Communication has improved a lot in the past few weeks, together with feedback and interest. We are still open to surprises!

Last but not least, the interview on ARTS THREAD [has been published](https://www.artsthread.com/coding-can-combined-skills-benefit-job-success/), woah.
