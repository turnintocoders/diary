# 2018 - 38-41

I'm bundling a few weeks as they've been very busy but very similar.

I'm trying to close as quickly as possible the projects that I've going on to be able to work more on the next bootcamp.

Meanwhile I've organised a workshop during one Coding for everyone event, about the terminal. Here's the link [to the Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/events/fxjxspyxnbtb/) and to the [outline of the workshop](https://github.com/turnintocoders/learn-command-line).

Regarding the next bootcamp I've been in contact with companies willing to hire people to find a way to manage the scholarships. And I've also been in contact with prospective students.

I'm still not clear if I'm going to be able to start the bootcamp in January, but I'll do my best :)
