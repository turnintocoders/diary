# 2018 - 10 - TiC 1 - Week 5

Materials for week 5 are [here](https://github.com/turnintocoders/bootcamp/blob/master/week-5/README.md).

In this week we've started using databases, so we augmented week-2's todo list with a database. [Link here](https://github.com/TiC-1/Week5_project_database).

## External speakers

Fabrizio Monti, from [weLaika](https://dev.welaika.com/), kindly came over to present the company and give his feedback on our efforts. He also showed around his sharp terminal and editor setup, nice!

## Retrospective

We love our speakers.

Need more SQL practise and challenges, but went fine.

Good to split server with router, which we need to keep doing and understanding better.

The project wasn't a great success as time was spent more integrating the old code with the new needs. It would have been better to chose a different project altogether.

We should have focused more on delivering something working, maybe trying to plan things a bit better before. We need to do another project using the DB.

Apart from switching responsibilities we should also swap pairs, to make everyone work with everyone else.

We also need to do more ES6, especially going forward.
