Back to work at full steam!

Vitsoe is my constant work. Besides, I've started two new projects with the TiC-1 participants. A Drupal + mail migration and improvements and then a new WordPress website from scratch. Nothing really too complicated or JS intensive, but still good to learn how to work together.

Also, a new newsletter has come :)

__On techno chauvinism__

Hello!

I've recently encountered a new word that helps explain a concept that I particularly care about: it's techno chauvinism.

Technochauvinism is the idea that a technological solution to a problem is always superior to another one. That word has been brought up by the book Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World (https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/artificial-unintelligence). You can read an interesting interview with the author on The Verge (https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17384324/meredith-broussard-artifical-unintelligence-technology-criticism-technochauvinism).

I feel strongly about being careful on how we use technology and I always try to be skeptical before diving in a new tool or product. We should be more considerate and thoughtful about our physical and digital consuption, as in the end our digital lives are physical too. Everything seems abstract in a cloud, but in reality there are massive datacenters crunching data and resources for us. Take a look at the Facebook datacenter to process our pictures (https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2016/09/29/facebook-data-center-photos/). Or you can look where Google stores our emails, maps, and searches (https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/).

It's truly remarkable and I am particularly keen in learning more and using technology. But I think we should just be more aware of what lies behind it.

A closely related topic is techno solutionism coined by Evgeny Morozov. He pushes us to think how much of our problems are we giving to private tech firm to solve via technological means, rather than trying to solve them via citizen participation and engagement. You can have a look at this short video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOvaNzIxz54) to listen him directly.

If you are interested in understanding more about technology and code, why don't you learn coding? You can join us in our weekly free meetup, next Monday, 18.30-20.30 @Toolbox Coworking, Torino. Here a link to RSVP and learn more (https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/events/fxjxspyxmbnb/).

Or if you already love coding you can join a group of friends practicing in a Coding Gym (https://coding-gym.org/). Reserve your place (https://www.eventbrite.it/e/biglietti-coding-gym-torino-settembre-2018-49705568694) for Saturday 29th of September, 11-13, @Toolbox Coworking.

Happy coding!
Matteo
