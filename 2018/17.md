# 2018 - 17

The week started with a good number of social relations. I've met Simone from [Veicoli](http://veicoliapp.com/), looking for some help in scaling his infrastructure. Hard problems ahead! Not sure if I've been of any help, but good thinking there.

Then we had a socially busy Coding for everyone, where I had a chance to chat with Elia Belussi, who is organising [a bit of history](http://www.abitofhistory.it/) and [Stefania Delprete](http://stefaniadelprete.com/), with whom we'll try organising some special CFE. Probably some evenings where we'll try contributing back to Mozilla's projects.

Then the short week, because of a public holiday, went on with a bootcamp visit to Top-Ix, a local Internet exchange interested in meeting with us, showing us around their office and maybe starting some collaborations.

Meanwhile we had good progress with Efficacemente, implementing the form using [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/).

Our WordPress projects, with Maison della Nocciola and Open House are going well. Hitting some bumps updating the existing plugins, but that's the usual business.
