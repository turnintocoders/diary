# 2018 - 9 - TiC 1 - Week 4

Materials for week 4 are [here](https://github.com/turnintocoders/bootcamp/blob/master/week-4/README.md).

The project app has been our first full-stack application. The [autocompleter](https://github.com/TiC-1/Week4_project_autocompleter). Part of the team worked on the Node.JS backend which is reading a file with 250k words, searching through it with the supplied letters and respond with ten matches. The frontend instead is sending the letters every time that one is pressed and displays the result sent from the server.

Again we've worked without using any framework or library, to understand how server and client interact and how to handle data to and from the browser.


## External speakers

We had a video call with Matteo Latini from [Nebulab](https://nebulab.it/) which had kindly agreed in talking with us about their work with [Solidus](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus) an ecommerce software using Ruby on Rails. Again a completely different set of skills compared to what we do in the bootcamp, but very interesting and refreshing.

[Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinruskov/), a friend of mine, came along to discuss his experience and give feedbacks on the bootcamp. Was a nice and insightful chat that left many things to think about to everyone. Thank you!

Fabio from [Cognitio](https://cognitio.it/) came to show their product: [Plenus](https://www.plenus.cloud/) a platform as a service to manage containers. A devops perspective on what we do. Fabio took a long time to explain how things work with containers and how to use Plenus. Very positive feedback on the lesson and the possibilities of the platform.


## Retrospective

Speakers were again praised.

Coda along and Node girls was good.

Being only one team we lack a bit of discussion and comparisons with other projects. Peeking at other FAC projects was appreciated and a good learning experience.

We need more challenges on callbacks, JS algorithms, APIs, SQL (that was just introduced for the coming week).

Project was good, but we need more careful on the division of responsibilities to avoid unbalancing the team. Critique in particular on only one person working on the frontend.
