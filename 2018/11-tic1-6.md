# 2018 - 11 - TiC 1 - Week 6

Materials for week 6 are [here](https://github.com/turnintocoders/bootcamp/blob/master/week-6/README.md).

While exploring how login works and databases we've implemented a naif version of Twitter, our [Tweeter](https://github.com/TiC-1/Week6_project_login).

## External speakers

Giorgio Bernardi, from [Inrete](http://inrete.it/) came to give his feedback on the week. He is my former mentor during my internship at university. Was nice to meet again after a few years. Always keen to give feedback and have a sane confrontation on how to improve what we've been doing.

## Retrospective

We've found the need of exploring more ES6 syntax, it's coming again and again in docs. Also promises are an interesting and still a bit obscure topic.

About docs, we need to carry on discovering tools, frameworks, libraries. Now that we know about them, we can't live without.

We also need to spend some time improving our raw JS skills, both in writing code and tests.

We've improved a lot on team organisation and project development, but there's need for more time and more tries.
