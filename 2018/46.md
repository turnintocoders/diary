# 2018 - 46

Most important feature of the week is the [Coding for everyone workshop: put your website online on Github Pages](https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/events/fxjxspyxpbqb/).

In the workshop we built on top of the last two workshops about the [terminal](https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/events/fxjxspyxnbtb/) and [landing pages](https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/events/fxjxspyxnbmc/) introducing Git and Github pages.

This week I was able to progress also on Torino Wireless before a hiatus that we'll go into because of a big event they are organising.
