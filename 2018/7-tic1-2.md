# 2018 - 7 - TiC 1 - Week 2

Materials for week 2 are [here](https://github.com/turnintocoders/bootcamp/blob/master/week-2/README.md).

The project of the week has been a [todo app](https://github.com/TiC-1/Week2_project_todoAPP). Our first frontend only website. The app is built without using any library or framework, starting from a skeleton. The focus of the week was to learn DOM manipulation and introduce the team to the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).


## External speakers

We've been visited by Simone, from [MaieuticalLabs](https://maieuticallabs.it/) that has shown a React project talking a bit about what the company is doing which is Django&Flask, React&Redux and some legacy projects in Angular and jQuery. Then we spent some time reviewing our todo app.


## Retrospective

We've started the week as two teams to converge into one. In hindsight this wasn't a good idea. For the following weeks we'll stick to one team only as this helps building better projects.

There is need for more practise on callbacks, DOM manipulation, basic JS and challenges in general. We need to setup some formal time to review challenges.

Also timings were a bit out of control and people spent more time on project than on challenges.

Code along was appreciated and we'll host at least one each week.

Unexpectedly, testing went fine!

Also pair programming was done a lot and well.

General enthusiasm for the project :)
