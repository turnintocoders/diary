# 2018 - 49 3-9/12

In this week [Coding for everyone - 24 Pull Requests](https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/events/fxjxspyxqbfb/)

I proposed to participate to [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/) a way to give back to open source. The idea is to do something every day, like: writing code, organising an event, answering questions on stackoverflow, writing blog posts about how to use a project, donating money to help pay a projects infrastructure costs, writing documentation, testing, translating and many other ways.

I've started myself as well and I found real enjoyment spending some time collaborating on open source projects that I like.

So far I've participated to [tracks](https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks) and [tomatoes](https://github.com/tomatoes-app/tomatoes) both projects on which I would like to keep working for the rest of the month.
