# 2018 - 15

Monday started very well with a special edition of Coding for everyone. We have had the first session with our friends from [Python Italia](http://associazione.python.it/) that have joined forces to add a Python track.

Focus of this week was to finish preparing for possible client's work. We sent out the quotes for the inquiries we had and we kept practicing on the bootcamp's projects.

We've been exploring possible technical solutions ranging from good old WordPress, to static website generators like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and simple shop solutions like [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/). I'll report on progresses as soon as we have official news.

I'm republishing here the links section from the newsletter that I've sent today. If you would like to receive the next one, leave us your email: http://turnintocoders.it/en/contacts.html

- [The Programmer's Oath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36NgPu9OyRM&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbno-B4RmJHCDO0ZUKC2tpUQ) it's a dense YouTube playlist with what a seasoned programmer like Uncle Bob thinks about our profession. In light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and self-driving car accidents (look [at this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8a0jfh/autopilot_barrier_lust_201812/) and you will understand what I mean) I think it's very important. If you haven't already, have a look at the interview of the Cambridge Analytica's whistleblower in full, or at least [start here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXdYSQ6nu-M&feature=youtu.be&t=7m59s). I don't think he's happy about what he did

- and now a bit of fun. Look at what you can fit in a single TCP packet: [the best TCP packet](http://packet.city/). If you don't know what a TCP packet is, it's the single unit of information transferred by the protocols running the web, around 1KB, tiny!

- a link of other link, the list of [awesome developer streams](https://github.com/bnb/awesome-developer-streams), very nice

- and finally have a look at [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/) a mega reference of most of web stuff. Very fast and all in one place. Handy! Plus they joined FreeCodeCamp recently, nice touch.
