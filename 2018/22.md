# 2018 - 22

This week I've been organising my presence at the local [Mini Maker Faire](https://torino.makerfaire.com/).

We are also planning the first local [Open Mozilla Night](https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/events/fxjxspyxjbpb/)! We hope to replicate this, or similar events with some regularity, hopefully with the contribution of our Coding for everyone community.
