# 2018 - 14

Short week to recover post-bootcamp :)

I took two days off and I still had two days to work on Vitsoe. Pretty small catching up before Friday when I've participated at the contributor day of the [Wordcamp Torino](https://2018.torino.wordcamp.org/) with Alberto.

My main interest was in seeing how a massive project like WordPress manages to evolve keeping hundreds (thousands?) of people involved in the process. I've joined the core team and I've prepared my first [code patch](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8973#comment:24), followed by [a second](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10653#comment:19) later in the day. I've also briefly joined the meta team to understand a problem in the Slack channels. Very interesting and I'll try contributing again, even just to better grasp how to contribute to such a big and important project.

Then I've started preparing to work on Open House Torino again. I've met with the organisers to understand the needs for the website and the volunteers form. I'll share the project with the bootcampers if nothing paid comes up, otherwise I guess it will count as a side project :)
