# 2018 - 3

We've finalised a minimum group of people attending the bootcamp. We can start, it's official! Starting date is 5th of Februrary. It's going to be a smaller group than initially planned, but it might be good as well, as it's easier for me to follow the participants, organise and change materials, or just make mistakes.

Coding for everyone went really well, we had a special meeting with [Melacavo](http://melacavo.io) joining and helping out with a session on console usage. I've put together a [small piece of documentation](https://github.com/turnintocoders/learn-command-line) that was mostly the outline of the evening, but might grow in something more structured.

I've been working hard on [Freelance Day](http://www.freelanceday.it/) to go live with the first revision. Still stuff to do, but getting together :)
