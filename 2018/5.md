# 2018 - 5

This week I've been stupidly busy trying to finish as many things as I could before the bootcamp, including paying bills sorting stuff and following up with projects.

But most importantly, I've finalised the [bootcamp material](https://github.com/turnintocoders/bootcamp) picking up on news and feeding back to Founders and Coders.

Fingers crossed!
