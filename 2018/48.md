# 2018 - 48

Last workshop of the 4-episodes series: [Coding for everyone workshop: add some JavaScript to our landing pages](https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/events/fxjxspyxpbjc/)

This is the second episode of our workshop on [how to build a landing page from scratch](https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/events/fxjxspyxnbmc/) on how to add the JS code needed to add some interactions.

Then a newsletter reached my dear subscribers: [Bootcamp in January, with scholarships! (and 24 pull requests)](https://tinyletter.com/turnintocoders/letters/bootcamp-in-january-with-scholarships-and-24-pull-requests)

In which, apart from reminding the deadline of the bootcamp, I've proposed to participate to [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/) during our Coding for everyone events.

On the consultancy side I finally made work the export from the existing Torino Wireless website to the new WordPress one. I managed to get the data out via the existing RSS feed, tweaking it a bit :)
