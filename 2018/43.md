# 2018 - 43

The big event has been the [3rd Show and Tell](43-show-tell-3.md) detailed in its own entry.

Then I've sent the [latest newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/turnintocoders/letters/new-workshop-let-s-create-an-html-css-landing-page), about the workshop of next week.

Last but not least, I've quickly visited the [Linux Day](https://linuxdaytorino.org/2018/) while the kids were napping :P

I've just had a quick overview, but I was impressed by the amount of people involved and by the quality of the speakers. Great stuff! I hope to be more involved next year.
