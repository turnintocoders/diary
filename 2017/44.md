This week wasn't very productive for Turn into Coders as I had to stay with the kids most of the time. One good news though, we have had an inquiry from a prospective student from San Francisco! Word is spreading, cool stuff. Plus we've put more posters and cards in universities in town.

Plus, we have our first real application for the bootcamp, YAY.

We are thinking about participating to the Chatbot hackathon with a Turn into Coders' team, we'll decide at the next Coding for everyone meetup.
