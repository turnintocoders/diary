# 2017 - 24

We have started really advertising our first Meetup: https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/events/240481236/

And sent out our first newsletter (Italian only): http://tinyletter.com/turnintocoders/letters/bollettino-turn-into-coders

Plus Toolbox published our blog post here: http://www.toolboxoffice.it/turn-into-coders/

I've found this free bootcamp: https://born2code.it/ happening in Rome, sponsored by the insurance company Groupama.
