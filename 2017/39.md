# 2017 - 39

We had a good attendance at Coding for everyone. Just a bit of network problems initially.
I spent a morning attaching posters at Politecnico with Bruno, so cool.
I spent most of my available time working on Piemonte fabbriche aperte with Claudio. It started as a "clone" of Open House Torino, so we reused most of what we did for OHT. Needs more work.
Then I visited Toolbox a couple of times for the latest things in preparation for the room. The space is going to be ready last minute, but hey!
We opened the invitation to use the space to friends so that we can test the full-house next week. I'm very excited and I hope to find more candidates for the bootcamp. At the moment we don't have enough people and we might be forced to delay the beginning until next year.
