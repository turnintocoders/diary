# 2017 - 25

We had our first Meetup! Very exciting! We had a very good attendance, around 35 people, some of which very very motivated. Hope to see them again next week. We were a bit too many for giving proper feedback to everyone, but still quite good. Looking forward to the next one!

We gave a couple of followups to the evening, a mutual help chat: https://gitter.im/turnintocoders/codingforeveryone and a feedback form: https://goo.gl/forms/eQGz10KYbbOr0Le22

We planned two more Meetups before a summer break, not sure when we'll start again, probably in September?

Talent Garden opened a new space in Turin, very nice, probably launching a bootcamp there soon.

Meanwhile Bezos visited Turin and spoke about future of newspaper (Italian article): http://www.lastampa.it/2017/06/21/speciali/150-anni/the-future-of-newspapers/con-i-grandi-gruppi-editoriali-si-pu-scommettere-sul-futuro-oXOXeURPV2x0n6kkBlJWWL/pagina.html a good quote from there: "Dal 2013 sono arrivati investimenti, nuovi giornalisti, un nuovo Chief Technology Officer. I giornali diventeranno aziende tecnologiche? La risposta è che lo dovrebbero essere già". We need coders in every new meaningful company.
