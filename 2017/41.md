# 2017 - 41

[Mini-bootcamp 2](https://github.com/turnintocoders/mini-bootcamp) started with a workshop on [command line](https://github.com/turnintocoders/learn-command-line) and then with setting up a Raspberry Pi with our own web server.
Since we were a handful of people we managed to go faster and we went ahead building something on the Github pages and more FreeCodeCamp training.
Plus this week we've decided to postpone the bootcamp to February, as we don't have enough candidates at the moment, and we are going to add one month of pre-bootcamp in January. We've updated the website to reflect the decision and we've updated the pricing, introducing some discounts for early birds.
