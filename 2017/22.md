# 2017 - 22

Updated the copy to the website, because we launched our first Meetup with the Toolbox newsletter of June.

So we set up a stub of our Coding for everyone meetup, launching 21st of June.

We prepared also a blog post on Toolbox's blog, coming up soon.

The OpenHouse form for volunteers didn't work very well :( We had a very high spike (kind of expected, though) of subscriptions in the initial minutes and the form couldn't keep up in updating the buildings availabilities. I had o manually disable some to avoid worsening the situation. Learnt something for the next round, unfortunately created some trouble for the people managing manually the double subscriptions.
