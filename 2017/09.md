# First things First

This will be a simple weekly diary of what we are doing to create Turn into coders.

First techy things done were:

- registration of domains turnintocoders.it, .com, .eu with GiDiNet https://www.gidinet.com/

- registration of hosting space and email addresses with 1984 https://www.1984hosting.com/

- registration of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page and accounts

Then we started the conversation with Cantiere Creativo https://www.cantierecreativo.net/ about branding, marketing, etc.

We are also in contact with Open Incet http://openincet.it/ to find a physical space to host Turn into coders.
