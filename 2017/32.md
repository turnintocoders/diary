# 2017 - 32

We started the week with a good summer event of Coding for everyone. Very good to see people after the summer break.

I had a nice meeting with Matteo of [Leva](http://leva.io) about them hiring Turn into Coders students. Their stack is based on Rails and React, so we need to understand how to blend our course with their requirements. We will be in touch soon.
