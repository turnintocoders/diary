# 2017 - 11

Main progress during this week has been around branding, with Juana producing another awesome iteration https://indd.adobe.com/view/7ba45639-e071-42f7-9eb1-113929395f51

The other area on which something has moved is around the foundation of the company that will happen in the coming week. So a bit of administration needed my focus.

Good news about the call "Open Innovation for Smart and Inclusive Cities"! Turn into coders has been selected as one of the 20 finalists, still waiting for more news though.

Future actions might include the application to Foundamenta #3 http://socialfare.org/it/foundamenta-3/
