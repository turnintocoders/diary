Merry Christmas!

Very quiet week, finalising some content for next week, working just a couple of days. Feels almost relaxing :P

I've finalised my contribution to a consultancy I've done with [Officine Innesto](http://officine.cc) using [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/). I'm happy having spent some time fiddling with it, because it's a very powerful and interesting project. I seriously want to automate parts of my studio. I've got all the components already, I just need some time or friends to do it.
