# 2017 - 43

Busy week, started with our usual Monday evening meetup. I've been in touch with many people. First I've met [Massimo Pot√¨](http://massimopoti.it/) for a chat about our Social Media strategy, in conjuction with [Digital Pills](http://www.digitalpills.it/). Then I had a chance to chat with Giampaolo of [Trampoline](http://trampolineup.com/) about a project on which I might need to chime in. I've also had a quick with Paola Pisano (Smart City, Innovation, ICT deputy mayor of Turin's municipality) and Fabio Fogli, part of her team. They are trying to set up a digital team with coding skills and they were interested in learning more about Turn into Coders. I've also been in touch with Marcello Minozzi of [We-Plus](http://www.we-plus.eu) but we couldn't meet yet.
This busy week ended with a talk at the local [Linux Day](http://linuxdaytorino.org/2017/), about naivechain, a minimal blockchain developed in JavaScript. The code is [here](https://github.com/matjack1/naivechain) and the presentation [here](https://matjack1.github.io/naivechain).
