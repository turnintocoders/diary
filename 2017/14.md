# 2017 - 14

With Laura, we've been working on copy for the website and some paper ad to start the "Coding for everyone" (https://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/events/238909642/) events in Turin.

I've also been visiting Open Incet spaces and took some pictures of the rooms, very nice indeed!

As the previous week development of openhousetorino.it went ahead a bit.

A couple of interesting articles read during the week:
