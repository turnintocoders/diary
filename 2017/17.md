# 2017 - 17

I have to take a forced break for a while as my second son is born on the 29th of April. Welcome Bruno!

Apart from the important news, I've been working more on OpenHouse Torino.

We have started discussing with Toolbox the possibility of hosting Turn into Coders in their coworking space and the first possibility is an excellent space at the entrance of the building. Exceptional visibility and nice space. Might be just a bit small, but good for beginning!

At the end of May, Toolbx will host the Mini Maker Faire, a very good opportunity to have some visibility with our new website. We are planning to have some advert on the glasses of our new space.
