# 2017 - 12

Complete focus of the week has been on preparing the foundation of the company Turn into coders, that happened on the 24th of March 2017.

We are now waiting for the last beaurocratic things to happen, but the official act has been made.

As soon as we'll have a VAT number I'll need to sort out the bank account, and then fill the application for the funding with Torino Social Innovation.

During the week I've also had a chance to meet Libre (http://libreidee.com/), which is working in the organisation on the Open Incet project (http://openincet.it/). I'm trying to be part of this project, as it seems a good networking possibility for people attending the courses and looking for a job or some initial training.
