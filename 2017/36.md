# 2017 - 36

We started the week as usual with our Coding for everyone meetup, which is the usual pleasure :)
I'm very happy as we have another candidate for the bootcamp!! Hurrah!
On Friday I've spent the entire day in Pescara with Antonio Trabalza, a Founders and Coders graudate, which I've kindly been introduced to by Dan Sofer. I've travelled half the country to meet Antonio as he's going to help me out with the teaching in the bootcamp and I wanted to spend some time with him and know him better. We had a very nice and productive time together, fleshing out the program of the bootcamp and also making sure that Founders and Coders is aware of us working together and that is all cool. At the end of our time together we agreed on the content of the bootcamp and mini-bootcamps, plus on the next steps going forward.
I've been invited to speak at the Linux Day, but not sure what I can bring to the table, I need to think more on this.
