Coding for everyone is the now usual good time, happy me :)
This and next week we need to pump as much as possible with advertisement. So we printed more posters and more cards. Although we printed the cards with an error. We are also pushing on FB an Twitter.
At last we have an English translation of the website. It's fully translated, with forms and everything, just missing the newsletter, which is still for Italians only.
We contacted everyone attending the mini-bootcamp as the application date has closed. Not everyone is able to join as other things popped up, but we should be around 10 people.
