# 2017 - 33

We are still big in the holiday season now. We have paused Coding for everyone for a week, and I'm spending time in the mountains with my family :)

We are looking into [#100DaysOfCode](http://100daysofcode.com/) challenge, to help keep momentum while learning something new in programming. Let's do it!
