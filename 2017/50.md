# 2017 - 50

On Monday at Coding for everyone I was able to [open a PR](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/16181) to FreeCodeCamp and get it merged, hurrah! Was a nice and welcoming experience, I want to do it again!

Some fellows participants of Coding for everyone are starting their own side project: [green tracker](https://github.com/green-cani/green_tracker). I'm very proud of their progress and I'll try supporting them as much as I can. Go check out their progression ;)

I've also added the banner of [Battle for the net](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) on Turn into Coders's website as I think the battle for net neutrality is fundamental to our online rights.

Usual, plus extra consulting work going on these weeks, I'm try to finish as much stuff as possible before the bootcamp.
