We completed the work on copywriting for the website and sent it out. Hopefully the website will come soon!

On openhousetorino.it side the website went live, most of the work there should be done.

I've also been attending BotConference (https://www.eventbrite.it/e/biglietti-botconference-2017-32371268335) at Toolbox (http://www.toolboxoffice.it/), which could be another possible space for Turn into coders. Surely the conference helped, but the space was very busy and lively, very good atmosphere.

A couple of interesting reads:
