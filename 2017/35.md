# 2017 - 35

At our [Coding for everyone meeting](https://www.meetup.com/turn-into-coders/events/241974521/) we have introduced the weekly mini-bootcamps that we would like to organise for the first three weeks of October.
They are meant to be a way to finish the requirements for the bootcamp, a way of pushing through FreeCodeCamp, or just an easy way to try the feeling of attending a bootcamp, without committing to 8 weeks.

I've been contacted by a couple of friends and former clients for some consultancy work. I'm considering asking to prospective students some help, in exchange of lowering the bootcamp fees. Let's see if the project become more serious first :)

Dan of [Founders and Coders](http://foundersandcoders.com/) has been in touch, as I'm still interested in getting former students to help me teach at the bootcamp. I've been put in contact with Antonio, that I'm planning to visit next week.

Thanks to Roberto Mossetto of [Jaguar28](http://jaguar28.com/) I've met Mattia Conte and Daniele Alberti of [Starboost](http://starboost.it), which is a very interesting local startup incubator, with whom would be nice to collaborate somehow. They offered help in communicating our bootcamp, which shares some basic principles with what they do.

Finally the first Show&Tell happened. More on that in a separate page.
