# 2017 - 40

[Mini-bootcamp 1](https://github.com/turnintocoders/mini-bootcamp) went quite well, we had aroun 10 people attending overall, which helped out knowing each other and learning some code in FreeCodeCamp and CodeWars.
I spent some of my week working on Fabbriche aperte to finish most of the work.
