The work on branding is a bit on hold. Before going ahead we need to work out the copy and a wireframe for the website.

Meanwhile I've been in contact with Bellissimo (http://www.bellissimo1998.com) as they are working on Open House Torino (http://www.openhousetorino.it/), a free event to promote architecture and the city. I've offered to volunteer for the realisation of the website as it is a good opportunity to gain some visibility for Turn into coders, and because is a good typology of non-profit jobs on which people finishing the courses could work on. So doing it as an example could be a good starting point.

As an aside I've attended to a couple of events of Biennale Democrazia (http://www.biennaledemocrazia.it), one with Evgeny Morozov about Internet & democracy (http://www.lastampa.it/2017/04/01/cultura/tuttolibri/internet-ci-render-pi-liberi-se-ci-ribelliamo-ai-padroni-del-silicio-uFl7CJnl5U09pLvKrOBFmK/pagina.html http://www.futura.news/2017/04/04/evgeny-morozov-internet-non-rende-mondo-piu-democratico/) and Roberto Saviano (http://www.futura.news/2017/04/03/33051/), both heavily centered on Internet. Obviously Morozov, but interestingly a lot also Saviano, starting with sharing some YouTube videos and some Instagram celebrities.
