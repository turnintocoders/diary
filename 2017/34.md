# 2017 - 34

Coding for everyone is back! After the meetup I've improved the [support material](https://github.com/turnintocoders/codingforeveryone/blob/master/meetup-support.md) that we are using, to include more resources and give a better structure.

We are getting more email inquiries about the bootcamp. Good news!

Next week we'll host a Show&Tell event, with a bunch of former colleagues and friends. Looking forward to it!
