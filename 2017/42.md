# 2017 - 42

We were supposed to start the third mini-bootcamp, but we didn't do it as we had only a couple of registered people. We left the space open for participation, and we had 3-4 people coming to work on FreeCodeCamp or their own projects.
We've prepared a [small presentation](https://turnintocoders.github.io/presentation/) of Turn into Coders, for Antonio to use in London at a couple of Meetups. We also translated our postcards and printed in English for him to use in the UK.
Our bootcamp now features also on [Course Report](https://www.coursereport.com/schools/Turn-into-Coders) and [SwitchUp](https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/turn-into-coders) to try reach more international students.
