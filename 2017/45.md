# 2017 - 45

Week dense with social interactions. Had an intersting and productive meeting at [We-Plus](http://www.we-plus.eu/), a company interested in our bootcamp, as they are always looking for talents. Then I had the chance to talk with [Gap Multimedia](http://www.netwalk.eu/about-us), a company based in Milan interested in our approach to teaching and learning. Always bootcamp related, we had an inquiry from Thailand, amazing!

Rest of the week was mainly about preparing the [landing page workshop](https://github.com/turnintocoders/landing_page_workshop/) with Antonio and promoting it around.

Finally I've been spending some time organising the next show and tell, at last!

A couple of links about Milan and the Italian digital commissioner. Both in Italian, sorry.
