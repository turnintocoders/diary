# 2017 - 37

This week at Coding for everyone I had the chance to meet the candidates for the bootcamp. They are very motivated, we just need to find more :)
We attended at the Toolbox breakfast, which is a very nice initiative to let coworkers join at once and know a bit better. We chatted with old and new friends, very nice.
Straight after that I went for a trip to Ikea with Aurelio, which was very nice for me as I managed to know him a bit better and also because we discussed many details of our future space in Toolbox, which is coming up very nice indeed.
We also printed some A3 posters and postcards to promote the bootcamp. We started putting them up at universities, let's see.
We've also started doing some paid adverts on Facebook, to better promote our page and contents.
One very nice feedback that we received on Facebook has been a post from Startup grind Torino's organiser, Roberto Mossetto. [Here's the post](https://www.facebook.com/startupgrindtorino/photos/a.109214979612445.1073741828.101299643737312/225455581321717/?type=3&theater).
