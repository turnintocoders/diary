# 2017 - 10

In the past couple of weeks the work on logo and branding has started. I've been working with Juana of Cantiere Creativo on inspirations and a moodboard https://indd.adobe.com/view/1435789c-3656-4d6c-8244-3ba4afd32252.

I've had a meeting with Settore nuove imprese (https://www.to.camcom.it/settore-nuove-imprese) and discussed with my accountant about possible legal options. In the following weeks we should set up the company.

For the call about "Open Innovation for Smart and Inclusive Cities" (http://www.torinosocialinnovation.it/post-it/open-innovation-for-smart-and-inclusive-cities/) has been made an application, with subscription to the Global Innovation Exchange (https://www.globalinnovationexchange.org/node/37530/).
