# 2017 - 48

I've started a new project for [Officine Innesto](http://officine.io) involving JavaScript, Hubot, Home Assistant, and some other buzzwords :) Not much time for it, but hope to get it done soon.

Started working with [Massimo](http://massimopoti.it/) about our online presence. Website, newsletter, Meetup, social networks... everything! I expect to change many things ;) Hopefully you'll see some changes soon.
