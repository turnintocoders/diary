# 2017 - 19

In this week we have finalised the design for the homepage: https://invis.io/JUBJYXT96

I've also visited the space at Toolbox that could be used for Turn into Coders. Very promising! We'll be crammed in there, but there's the entire coworking at just a doorstep, so we have loads of extra space to use when needed.

Plus, we carried on with the bank account, which is now open.

Finally OpenHouse Torino has use all my available development time, both on website and Google Form customisation.
