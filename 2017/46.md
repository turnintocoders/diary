# 2017 - 46

Time for our first workshop! With Antonio we prepared a presentation and a couple of demo landing pages. Slides and HTML+CSS are [on Github](https://github.com/turnintocoders/landing_page_workshop/).

I've made good progress with the financing of FaciliTO. I think I've mostly finished. I just have to spend some money now.

I've also attended an event of [Nex.to.it](http://nex.to.it/) about smart mobility at Talent Garden. Very fancy.
We have a couple new hosts in our nice space at Toolbox. They are the masters of the robots of [DigifabTURINg](https://digifabturing.github.io/LandingPage/). We have also an awesome mechanical arm in our room. Impressive.

I've spent some time experimenting with [ScriptCraft](https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft) that could work with [MQTT](https://github.com/walterhiggins/scriptcraft-extras-mqtt) to talk to Arduino or so. Needs some more work to set up everything, but would be awesome for some teaching with youngsters.

On a sad not we had our website and email down for a couple of days. Big problem at [our provider](https://1984hosting.com/), that struggled heavily. I've set up a backup on [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/), but I'm now back to 1984.
